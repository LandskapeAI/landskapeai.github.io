      <description>$\psi(x) = \tanh(\log(1+{e}^{x}))$
 This equation was the foundational point of my advent in deep learning. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely fascinated and curious of understanding the underlying theoretical mechanisms governing deep learning methods especially in the domain of Mean Field Theory, Non Convex Optimization and Non-Linear Dynamics. I am also inclined towards fundamental research in computer vision especially in the continously evolving sub-domains of Adversarial Robustness, Continual Learning and Self-Supervised Learning.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a senior at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, majoring in Mathematics and Computing. I&amp;rsquo;m heavily inclined towards the theoretical aspects of deep learning and the math behind the algorithms. I have previously worked in the fields of Data-Driven Discovery of Integral-Differential Equations, Non-Convex Optimization and Attention Mechanisms in Vision. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on the application of Reinforcement Learning in a medical setting, along with more fundamental research topics such as Activation Functions and Optimization methods.</description>

      <description>Who we are We are a small team of multi-disciplinary researchers who have a similar goal to explore the facets of theory underlining the abstraction of deep learning. Our team has cumulative experience in graphics, film making, hardware optimization, computer vision, software engineering, astrophysics and extensive knowledge in visualization, optimization and mathematics.
What we do Our goal is to explore the theoretical avenues of deep learning which haven&amp;rsquo;t been extensively discussed and try to connect the dots to have a more firm and concrete understanding of deep learning and the black box associated to it.</description>
