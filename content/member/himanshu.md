I am a graduate student in Machine Learning at the Montr√©al Institute for Learning Algorithms (Mila). Before joining Mila, I worked as a Team Lead at Accenture AI, focusing on Natural Language Processing. I have recently acquired a keen research interest in Computer Vision and Self-Supervised Learning. I am currently working on the applications of Image-Based Visual Servoing for open control scenarios such as intersection navigation in Autonomous Vehicles.
