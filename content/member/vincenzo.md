I’m a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Bologna, Italy (supervisor: Davide Maltoni) and Co-Founding President of [ContinualAI](https://www.continualai.org/), a non-profit research organization and the largest open community on Continual Learning for AI. Currently, I’m also a Co-founder and Board Member of [AI for People](http://aiforpeople.org/) and Director of the [ContinualAI Lab](https://www.continualai.org/lab/). I obtained my PhD at UniBo in early 2019 with a dissertation titled “[Continual Learning with Deep Architectures](http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/9073/)”: a natural continuation of my master’s thesis on bio-inspired deep architectures I started in 2014.

For more than 5 years I have been working as a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning and Computer Architectures courses in the Department of Computer Science of Engineering (DISI). In the past I’ve been a Visiting Research Scientist at Numenta (supervisor: Jeff Hawkins) in 2019, at ENSTA ParisTech (supervisor: David Filliat) in 2018 and at Purdue University (supervisor: Eugenio Culurciello) in 2017. Even before, I was a Machine Learning Software Engineer @ iDL in-line Devices and a Master Student @ UniBo.

My main research interest and passion is about Continual Learning in all its facets. In particular, I love to study Continual Learning under three main lights: Neuroscience, Deep Learning and Practical Applications, all within a AI Sustainability developmental framework.
